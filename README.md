# TechKnights Web Application Project

This repository contains the work that was done for the TechKnights Web Application workshops 1 and 2.

In part 1 we covered how to set up a single page angular application and create a node.js server to host it. The powerpoint for this workshop can be found at https://goo.gl/rwRGND

In part 2 we covered how to create a mongoDB database and access it using our angular app as well as how to use some angular directives such as ng-repeat. This workshop picked up where part 1 left off so the code from part 1 is also in part 2
